This report is an exportatory data analysis on a dataset provided by the University of California at Irvine's Machine Learning department.  The dataset contains 1030 observations including 9 quantitative variables.  

The UCI ML Cement dataset records compressive strengh of cement in MPa (Megapascals) given 8 other input variables, which are the amonts of the components in Kg, and it's age in days.

The readme for the dataset can be downloaded here:

This study aims to define what a relatively strong concrete is in terms of compressive strength, then to see if we can predict the compressive strength of concrete based on the relative proportion of it's ingredients and it's age.
